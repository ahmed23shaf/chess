Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mb_usb_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mb_usb_i/hdmi_piece_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mb_usb_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
